  about:
    "All language. One world.Hello everyone! I do speak Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean, and plan to learn español. I really know how difficult to learn a foreign language, and would like to share the secret. Normally, I prefer to explain by using the easiest target words, but if you want to understand them better from your language, I can also explain in the language that makes you feel more comfortable. According to your level, I will adjust the speed and vocabs picking. Take you to an immersive environment without going to China, a more comfortable and interesting  as talking with a close friend.",
